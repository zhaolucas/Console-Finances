# Console-Finances
## This is the fourth challenge task for the skills bootcamp, in javascript. 

## The repository: 

The console finances application is an endeavor focused on a real-world situation by analyzing the financial records of a company from a dataset. 

The primary goal of the project is to ensure the concepts of inputting numerical operations in javascript are applied. 

Key skills include using fundamental javascript concepts like function, conditional, loop and variable, with some html that can display the page. 

This project is driven by the intention to apply mathematical operations with javascript functions. 

When opened, resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis 
  ----------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average Change: -2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```

![Alt text](<images/Screenshot 2023-12-08 at 18.35.07.png>)

The page loads two sections: 
1) a header 
2) on the console, showing the calculations 

The app answers the following questions: 
* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/(Number of months - 1)`)

* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

Final code should print the analysis to the console.
